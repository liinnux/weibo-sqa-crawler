This is a directed research project which is called **Social Q&A System Based on Relationships in Social Network**.

The goal is to using text mining techniques find the experts to answer the questions asked by the user by automatically  analyzing the personal profile of the friends and related contacts.

I developed the demo based on the *Weibo.Sina.com* which is the twitter in Chinese :).
